/**
 * Given a string S of length N consisting only of letters A and/or B. Our goal is to obtain a string in the format A...AB...B (all letters A occur before all letters B) by deleting some letters from S. In particular, strings consisting only of letters A or only of letters B fit this format.

Given a string S, returns the minimum number of letters that need to be deleted from S in order to obtain a string in the A...AB...B format.
