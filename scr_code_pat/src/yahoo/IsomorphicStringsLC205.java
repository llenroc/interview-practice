The main idea is to store the last seen positions of current (i-th) characters in both strings.
 If previously stored positions are different then we know that the fact theyâ€™re occuring in
  the current i-th position simultaneously is a mistake. We could use a map for storing
  but as we deal with chars which are basically ints and can be used as indices we can do the whole thing with an array.
